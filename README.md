# PlasmaVisualisations

These small Python scripts were created to accompany the lectures Introduction to Plasma Physics I and II as illustrations of different plasma phenomena. The fluid or particle codes used are deliberately kept as simple as possible to illustrate to students an introduction to the simulation of plasma phenomena. Accurate quantitative simulation is reserved for well-known simulation platforms such as Plasimo, nonPDPSIM, etc.
