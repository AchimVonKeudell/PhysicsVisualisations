These small Python scripts were created to accompany physics lectures as illustrations of different phenomena. A special emphasis is on plasma topics following the lectures <b>Introduction to Plasma Physics I and II</b>. The fluid or particle codes used are deliberately kept as simple as possible to illustrate to students an introduction to the simulation of plasma phenomena. Accurate quantitative simulation is reserved for well-known simulation platforms such as Plasimo, nonPDPSIM, etc. The following visualisations are implemented

## Plasma physics
* bubble (cavitation by plasma in liquids)
* dbm (dielectric breakdown model)
* driftdiffusion
  - drift diffusion model for 2 liquids (electrons, ions)
  - drift diffusion model for 3 liquids (electrons, ions, neg. ions)
* etch (isotropic and anisotropic plasma etching)
* fermi (stochastic heating, Fermi acceleration)
* fluid (2 fluid model for electron/ion density and velocity)
  - Debye Length
  - plasma frequency
* hc (hollow cathode effect) 
* mathieu (trajectory of an ion in a quadrupole)
* pic1d (1d particle in cell code)
* rfiedf (IEDF of ions impinging on a substrate)
* rfignition 
* singleparticle
  - particle drifts
  - magnetron
* streamer

## Optics and E-Dynamics
### Optics
* fresnel (Airy formula for Farby Perot filter, light raytracing)  
* huygens (Huygens principle for the reflection and diffraction of light)
* line (solution of the wave equation in time and space on a cable/fibre)
* wave (diffraction, boundary conditions)
### E-Dynamics
* hertz (dipole radiation)

## Mechanics
### Gravitation
* kepler (helio and geocentric world view)
* doublependulum (chaos)
* planet (planet orbits)
* planet3body (N body problem in mechanics)
### Waves
* lineexcited (solution of the 1d wave equations)
* mach (mach cones)
* wave (see also above)

## Thermodynamics
* gaskinetic (thermalization of a 2d distribution)

## Atom physics
* cross (Rutherford, Langevin scattering)

## Solid State Physics
* beam bending (elastic properties of materials, example steel)
* growth (growth of interfaces via random deposition)
  - ballistic deposition
  - surface diffusion
* trajectory (ion trajectory in a solid BCA approximation)
* md (Molecular dynamics of ion solid interaction)
