# Plasma Visualisations

These small Python scripts were created to accompany the lectures <b>Introduction to Plasma Physics I and II</b> as illustrations of different plasma phenomena. The fluid or particle codes used are deliberately kept as simple as possible to illustrate to students an introduction to the simulation of plasma phenomena. Accurate quantitative simulation is reserved for well-known simulation platforms such as Plasimo, nonPDPSIM, etc. The following visulazitaions are implemented

* bubble (cavitation by plasma in liquids)
* dbm (dielectric breakdown model)
* driftdiffusion
  - drift diffusion model for 2 liquids (electrons, ions)
  - drift diffusion model for 3 liquids (electrons, ions, neg. ions)
* etch (isotropic and anisotropic plasma etching)
* fermi (stochastic heating, Fermi acceleartion)
* fluid (2 fluid model for electron/ion density and velocity)
  - Debye Length
  - plasma frequency
* gaskinetic (thermalization of a 2d distribution)
* growth (growth of interfaces via random deposition)
  - ballistic deposition
  - surface diffusion
* hc (hollow cathode effect)  
* mathieu (trajectory of an ion in a quadrupole)
* pic1d (1d particle in cell code)
* rfiedf (IEDF of ions impinging on a substrate)
* rfignition 
* singleparticle
  - particle drifts
  - magnetron
* streamer
* trajectory (ion implantation in a solid)
